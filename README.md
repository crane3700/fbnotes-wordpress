# fbnotes-wordpress
Get a link from user's tweet and create WordPress post.

I created this plugin (WordPress) to import Facebook notes (from pages, not profiles) as WordPress posts.

Uses simple html dom: http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net and Simple PHP Wrapper for Twitter API v1.1 calls: https://github.com/J7mbo/twitter-api-php

Use as you deem fit, I am liable for nothing.

Email tope@xiungo.com if you have any questions, I try to respond quickly.
